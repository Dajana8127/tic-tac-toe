# Tic Tac Toe Game Project
The Tic Tac Toe app I built is a client-side app.

# The technologies used
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript
ajax
node.js
JQuery

The server provides authentication and persists the game objects. A user creates a user account, logs in and can then plays tic tac toe and views how many games they've played so far. Additionally, the authentication piece allows the user to change their password and log out. A game is created on the server and 2 players play until one player wins or there are no moves left, ie, a draw.

# Planning
My planning began with a thorough read of the game API and the assignmemt requirements. Then I developed a plan with a schedule and goals that I want to achive each day.

# User Stories
As a user I want to be able to create a user account/sign up and after that sign in.
Once I'm signed in I want to be able to press a button and play the game, to change my password, to view stats of my previously played games and sign out. I want to be able to start a new game(after the game has ended or even in the middle of the game.)

# Building the app
I started building the app by adding all html elements and some styling with css and Bootstrap. Next I moved on to the API requests for sign up, sign in, change password and sign out. After I made all of those work properly I started work on the game API requests. Once I got my game board to work, I worked on displaying a winner on the board and saving all the game data. At the end I added more styling and I would like to make some style improvments in the future.
